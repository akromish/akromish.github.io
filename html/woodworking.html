                    My first ever woodworking project. 
                    Strapped together a bunch of cedar planks using pocket holes and built a basic frame using 2x4s.
                    <br><br>
                    It's been a few years since it was built and it's still doing pretty good. 
                    Probably have ~5 herbs growing in it.

                    I cut up a sheet of plywood into 3/4" length pieces.
                    After cutting up ~25 pieces, I glued them up together to form the table top.
                    Planned them a little bit, promptly gave up with the hand plane, and went to a random orbital sander.
                    I was a bit lazy with the legs and just pocket holed them straight into the table top.
                    They're made up of the same plywood just doubled up.

                    Also, I made the website on this desk. :)

                    I got this craftsman 113 for a pretty good price from someone on craigslist.
                    Only paid $90 and it came with a dado set. 
                    It wasn't used for a while so it needed some work to get it back up to spec.
                    I scoured the top using an artificial scouring pad.

                    After losing any ability to move my arms, I stopped and moved onto waxing.
                    I liberally applied a coat of paste wax and voilla!
                    Works like a dream now.

            Bed Frame

                    After getting stuck back at home after the start of the pandemic, I figured
                    my room could use a little sprucing up. Thus was born an idea.(does speak english correct me?)
                    <br><br>
                    I started off wanting to build a bed with dovetails and other fancy joinery but
                    quickly learned that I am no pro. After that bombshell, I went back to the drawing board
                    and combined a couple of design plans plus some of my ideas to come up with my very own
                    design.
                    <br><br>
                    The biggest hurdle for me was getting the mortise and tenon joints to work.
                    Since I didn't have any chisels, in order to create mortises, I sawed off about 2 inch
                    from the ~7ft boards, used a regular table saw blade as a dado, and chiseled away about
                    half an inch on either side of my original cut. After all that, I glued the two pieces
                    together and had myself wonderful mortises. Then I did it three more times. Ouch.
                    <br><br>
                    Everything else was fairly routine and at the end everything came together surprisingly
                    easily. The bed is pretty neato and, as a bonus, it doesn't break when I sleep on it \s.
