                    My first ever woodworking project. 
                    Strapped together a bunch of cedar planks using pocket holes and built a basic frame using 2x4s.
                    <br><br>
                    It's been a few years since it was built and it's still doing pretty good. 
                    Probably have ~5 herbs growing in it.

                    I cut up a sheet of plywood into 3/4" length pieces.
                    After cutting up ~25 pieces, I glued them up together to form the table top.
                    Planned them a little bit, promptly gave up with the handplane, and went to a random orbital sander.
                    I was a bit lazy with the legs and just pocket holed them straight into the table top.
                    They're made up of the same plywood just doubled up.
                    <br><br>
                    Also, I made the website on this desk. :)

                    I got this craftsman 113 for a steal from someone on craigslist.
                    Only paid $90 and it came with a dado set. 
                    It wasn't used for a while so it needed some work to get it back up to spec.
                    I scoured the top using an artifical scouring pad.

                    After losing any ability to move my arms, I stopped and moved onto waxing.
                    I liberally applied a coat of paste wax and voilla!
                    Works like a dream now.
