                Hey there fellow human! 
                <br>
                <br>
                Thanks for checking out my website. It's not a masterpiece but it's my piece.
                <br>
                <br>
                My name is Akram Weheba and I'm a Software Engineer working at NetScout.
                <br>
                <br>
                I graduated from the University of Florida as a Microbiology major with a minor in CS.
                Back in highschool I took AP computer science and got to really enjoy programming.
                I fell out of touch with programming for a while until probably late 2018, when I decided to take a C++ course at UF.
                After taking the course I felt like I needed to get a minor in CS just so I could spend more time coding and not learning about pyruvate and ester linkages.
                I basically finished the Microbiology degree then decided that I didn't really want to be a doctor. 
                On the plus side, I'm pretty great with science.
                <br>
                <br>
                Since then I've had at least some experience with Java, C++, Python, SQLite, MariaDB, and now JS.
                Most of my real world experiences programming come from my experience at laboratories.
                While I was pre-health, I helped create scripts to analyze microscopic images. 
                We used staining to identify different cells. 
                Using those cells we'd create scripts to compute values such as relative densities, nuclei, etc.
                In my second lab, I helped on a cyber-security team that worked with voice processing systems attacks.
                We worked on different python scripts to trick software like google voice into executing a command using perturbed audio.
                <br>
                <br>
                Right now I feel most fluid in c++, but that fluctuates month to month. 
                <br>
                <br>
                When I'm not in hacker-man mode I like to build things(check out the woodworking page), mountain bike, and cook(and eat?!?!).
