        One day I found myself down a rabbit hole looking at website domains. I ended up finding a domain that had my github username(akromish) and impulse bought it for ~$10. 
        <br>
        <br>
        Before this project, I had no web dev experience. Naturally I was pretty clueless. I started by looking for where I needed to upload html on the goolge domains website. After some digging, I found out that I needed this thing magical thing called a host... 
        <br>
        <br>
        I searched around for a free host and(with the help of reddit) ended up on github pages. Made a quick page using their tutorial then setup my gihub page to connect to this website domain. A few weeks later, I started learning some basic html and css and this is what you're seeing now. It might not be perfect, but, as a first try it works pretty well. 
        <br>
        <br>
        I built this website exculisvley using html and css so in the future I'd like to look into using jekyll, which github pages supports, or using something like django to create a more powerful website.
