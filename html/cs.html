        <h4 class="blurb">
            One day I found myself down a rabbit hole looking at website domains. I ended up finding a domain that had my github username(akromish) and impulse bought it for ~$10. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Before this project, I had no web dev experience. Naturally I was pretty clueless. I started by looking for where I needed to upload html on the google domains website. After some digging, I found out that I needed this thing magical thing called a host...
            <br>
            <br>
            I searched around for a free host and(with the help of reddit) ended up on github pages. Made a quick page using their tutorial then setup my github page to connect to this website domain. A few weeks later, I started learning some basic html and css and this is what you're seeing now. It might not be perfect, but, as a first try it works pretty well.
            <br>
            <br>
            I built this website exclusively using html and css so in the future I'd like to look into using jekyll, which github pages supports, or using something like django to create a more powerful website.

        <h4 class="blurb">
            For a while, I was trying to find out if the Ender 3 Pro(a 3d printer) was in stock.
            I would check the website a few times a day to see if the elusive printer was finally back in stock.
            At some point, I realized that it was a really repetitive task that could probably be automated.
            <br>
            <br>
            I spent some time looking into how to make a 'bot' that could check stock for me.
            Everyone seemed to talk highly of selenium for python so I figured I would give it a try.
            I managed to get to the checkout page and start filling out shipping info using selenium by the time the printer was actually in stock.
            After that this project has been a bit on the backburner.
            Right now it accepts a product URL as an input from the creality3d.shop website and lets you know whether or not the printer is in stock.
            <br>
            <br>
            In the future, I might try to add code to allow the selenium bot to complete a purchase. 
            For now though, I'm going to enjoy my printer.

        <h4 class="blurb">
            This was my final project in my Data structures class. It's not anything amazing but it gets the job done.
            <br><br>
            What we wanted to do is determine if a b tree was faster than a b+ tree at insertions/searches/deletions.
            We imported a dataset and used a python script to generate a file of employees.
            From there we split up work for the three of us. I was responsible for the overall direction,
            the main testing functions, and debugging.

            Give it a try! It's pretty fun lol. (Also, here's a video of it in action by yours truly:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXUEzslABdI)
