        <h4 class="blurb">
            One day I found myself down a rabbit hole looking at website domains. I ended up finding a domain and impulse bought it for ~$10.
            <br>
            <br>
            Before this project, I had no web dev experience. Naturally I was pretty clueless. I started by looking for where I needed to upload html on the google domains website. After some digging, I found out that I needed this thing magical thing called a host...
            <br>
            <br>
            I searched around for a free host and(with the help of reddit) ended up on github pages. Made a quick page using their tutorial then setup my github page to connect to this website domain. A few weeks later, I started learning some basic html and css and this is what you're seeing now. It might not be perfect, but, as a first try it works pretty well.
            <br>
            <br>
            I built this website exclusively using html and css so in the future I'd like to look into using jekyll, which github pages supports, or using something like django to create a more powerful website.

        <a href="https://github.com/akromish/BikeInventory"><h3 class="blurb-title">Bike Inventory</h3> </a>
        <h4 class="blurb">
            One day, I found myself with a lot of bikes. Yikes. That rhymes.
            <br>
            <br>
            Any hoot, I figured since I had some free time and I was itching to learn about fullstack, I went ahead and tried my hand at a web app. First, I had to decide what stack
            to use. MEAN, MERN and so many more options. Since I had a software engineering class after the summer that was going to use MERN, it made the desicion easy.
            <br>
            <br>
            After picking MERN, I found a tutorial that helped me create a todo list. I followed the tutorial and came up with a basic todo list. From there, I went through each file, figured out
            how it worked, and then tried rewriting in as few lines as possible. I also decided to create a route file to help tidy up my server.
            <br>
            <br>
            After getting everything tidied up, I worked on the functionality I wanted when storing a bike.
            <br>
            <br>
            Future steps for this project would probably be adding in a login and deploying to heroku. Maybe also connect it to a mobile app.

            2+2=4, minus 1 equals 3, quick maths. Anyways...
            <br>
            <br>
            I helped create this app at the 2020 MedHacks. The track we chose to compete in was "Patient adherence during Covid." After talking to a mentor, we narrowed down the scope
            of our project. We decided that we wanted to create an app to help track medications and adherence to medications. We decided that, since we wanted a mobile app,
            using flutter/firebase was potential the fastest option as speed was key.
            <br>
            <br>
            The key functionalities we targeted were: 1. A login 2. A page with all medications and 3. A medication page with
            a calendar and questionnaire.
            <br>
            <br>
            Because the rest of my team was a little less experienced with cs, I helped them get through install git and git basics. I also helped the team set up their IDEs and
            download the flutter sdk. After that, I was responsible for the initial app creation, creating a git repository, and assigning tasks to the rest of the team.
            Working together, we managed to get a functional demo for the weekend and we created a presentation and devpost.(Available here: <a href="https://devpost.com/software/medtrack-0tr89g">Devpost</a>)

        <h4 class="blurb">
            This was my final project in my Data structures class. It's not anything amazing but it gets the job done.
            <br><br>
            What we wanted to do is determine if a b tree was faster than a b+ tree at insertions/searches/deletions.
            We imported a dataset and used a python script to generate a file of employees.
            From there we split up work for the three of us. I was responsible for the overall direction,
            the main testing functions, and debugging.
            <br><br>
            Give it a try! It's pretty fun lol. (Also, here's a video of it in action by yours truly: <a href=" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXUEzslABdI">Youtube</a>)

        <a href="https://github.com/akromish/Ender3Stock"><h3 class="blurb-title">Ender3Stock</h3> </a>
        <h4 class="blurb">
            For a while, I was trying to find out if the Ender 3 Pro(a 3d printer) was in stock.
            I would check the website a few times a day to see if the elusive printer was finally back in stock.
            At some point, I realized that it was a really repetitive task that could probably be automated.
            <br>
            <br>
            I spent some time looking into how to make a 'bot' that could check stock for me.
            Everyone seemed to talk highly of selenium for python so I figured I would give it a try.
            I managed to get to the checkout page and start filling out shipping info using selenium by the time the printer was actually in stock.
            After that this project has been a bit on the backburner.
            Right now it accepts a product URL as an input from the creality3d.shop website and lets you know whether or not the printer is in stock.
            <br>
            <br>
            In the future, I might try to add code to allow the selenium bot to complete a purchase. 
            For now though, I'm going to enjoy my printer.
